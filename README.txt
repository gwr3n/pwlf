pwlf provides an implementation of the techniques presented in 

R. Rossi, S. A. Tarim, B. Hnich and S. Prestwich, 
"Piecewise linear lower and upper bounds for the standard normal first order loss function", 
Applied Mathematics and Computation, Elsevier, Vol. 231:489-502, 2014
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.amc.2014.01.019
 
to piecewise linearise arbitrary loss functions. 

pwlf is maintained by Roberto Rossi, Full Professor at the University of Edinburgh.
